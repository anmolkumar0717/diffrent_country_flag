# Creating Country Flags with Turtle in Python

This project demonstrates how to create flags of different countries using the Turtle module in Python.

## Turtle Module

Turtle is a built-in Python module that enables users to create shapes, graphics, and animations using a simple drawing interface. It's commonly used for educational purposes to introduce programming concepts to beginners.

## Installation

The Turtle module comes pre-installed with Python. You can start using it in your Python environment without any additional installation steps.

## Usage

1. **Import the Turtle module**:

   In your Python script, import the Turtle module:

   ```python
   import turtle
Create a Turtle object:Create a Turtle object to draw shapes on the screen:
python
Copy code
screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()
Set up the Turtle window:Set up the window size and other properties:
python
Copy code
screen.setup(width, height)
Draw the flag:Use Turtle commands to draw the flag shapes and colors:
python
Copy code
t.penup()  # Lift the pen to avoid drawing lines
t.goto(x, y)  # Move the turtle to the starting position
t.pendown()  # Lower the pen to start drawing

# Draw shapes and fill colors
# Example: Draw a rectangle for the flag
t.begin_fill()
t.color("color_name")
t.goto(x1, y1)
# Draw other points to complete the shape
t.end_fill()
Display the flag:Once the flag is drawn, display it on the screen:
python
Copy code
screen.mainloop()
Example
Here's an example of how to create the flag of Japan using the Turtle module:

python
Copy code
import turtle

screen = turtle.Screen()
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Set up the window
screen.setup(600, 400)

# Draw the flag
t.penup()
t.goto(-100, 100)
t.pendown()
t.begin_fill()
t.color("red")
for _ in range(4):
    t.forward(200)
    t.right(90)
t.end_fill()

t.penup()
t.goto(0, 0)
t.pendown()
t.begin_fill()
t.color("white")
t.circle(50)
t.end_fill()

screen.mainloop()
Flags to Create
You can create flags of various countries by using the Turtle module and appropriate coordinates, shapes, and colors. Here are a few examples you can try:

Bolivia
Swedan
Hungry
Bangladesh
India
Germany
Feel free to explore and create flags of other countries as well!
